# TicTacToe
The Tic Tac Toe game on the home page offers the option to play with 2 players or with the computer.

- In 2 player mode the game is played by clicking on the squares to color them. Player 1 colors the squares red, while player 2 colors the squares blue. There is also an undo button that can be clicked to erase the last colored square, either red or blue. Clicking the restart button restarts the game, clearing all fields.

- In single player mode, the player plays against the computer. When the player clicks on a certain field, it is colored red, and the computer automatically chooses which field to color. The game also offers undo and restart buttons.

At the end of the game, regardless of the selected mode, a score is displayed to show which player won or there was a tie.
